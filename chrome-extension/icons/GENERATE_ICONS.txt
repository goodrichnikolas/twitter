To generate icons for this extension:

1. Open ../generate-icons.html in your browser
2. Click "Download All"
3. Save icon16.png, icon48.png, and icon128.png to this folder

Or use any icon generator online and create 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files.

The extension will work without icons, but they make it look more professional!
